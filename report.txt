Status: Completed

Outstanding Issues:
Given that it was my first ever time making an HTML file, the code wasn't horrible but could have definitely been cleaner

Major Impediments:
N/A

Feedback Comments:
I enjoyed the workflow of having fellow classmates review our git commits and make 
comments of their own. Given that one of Github's outstanding features is its ability
to work with others I wish we could've done one or two more labs where we learn how
to code alongside others since I've been told this is common in at home tech jobs.
